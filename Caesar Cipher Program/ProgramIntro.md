A program to change any message into an encoded version, based on the earliest real life encryption technique - 'Caesar's Cipher'
used by Julius Caesar of ancient Rome. 
The program takes in a String message and a 'shift' value (offsets the characters forward in the alphabet by this number). 
It outputs the string result after the encryption. The code is limited to positive shift values under 104.
